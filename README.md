### Pomodoro app

## About The Project

This project is for educational porpuses only. In this project I try to make pomodoro app that can be used for studying and work using React.js. This project took a lot of my time because I work on it at my free time. I refreshed a lot of things and tools how use them with each other. I had a lot of hard challenges that I manage to overcome bug fixing was the beast part had a LOT of fun with it. =)
